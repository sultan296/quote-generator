# quote-generator

In this project, I showcase a quote generator website that I've created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The site features a layout that displays a quote of the day along with the author's name. Users can click a button to generate a new quote, which pulls data from an API for a fresh experience each time. Additionally, there's a tweet button that allows users to share their favorite quotes directly on Twitter. Check it out to see how you can easily generate and share inspirational quotes!
